title: Mix of the Year 2010

Its finally here.
=================

#Intro

I know this is a long time coming, but I have been busy.  Works been crazy, 
married life is crazy, but fun.  I think I've done a decent job keeping up 
despite the fact I am now more boring.  I've been immersing myself in software 
development to make up lost time, such that I can be equally competent as a 
software engineer as being a mechanical engineer.  I think it's come along well.
This mix has been 90% done since late last year, but I have tinkered at it over the last
6 months.  

As you'll also notice, I've shifted to digital.  This reflects a change in my life
to basically get rid of all material objects in my life, not because I don't like
material things, but it's basically the only way for me to be neat with personal possessions.

# The List

1.  **Little Red - [Cathy Davey](http://www.myspace.com/cathydavey) - The Nameless - 3:55**

    I heard this song in Ireland driving back from Dingle to Tralee on the N86.
    Have only seen this album in Ireland and not the US.  Another Irish artist who
     didn't make the list was [Jedward](http://www.planetjedward.net/).

2.  **Cut Me Out - [MNDR](http://mndr.com/) - Green Label Sound - 3:15**

    MNDR opened for Chromeo.  She's a one man show but seems to use [OpenFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) 
    or [Processing](http://processing.org/) for her background slideshow, which 
    I thought was cool because I used OpenFrameworks for the photobooth and my 
    slideshow software.  Great opening performance all things considered.

3.  **Neato     Baxendale   Music for Girls EP (2000) - 3:45**

    These guys return to the list since they fit in well now.  

4.  **Radio - The Avalanches - Since I left You (2000) - 4:06**

    I brought these guys back to help transition.  Still no word on a new album.

5.  **Night By Night - Chromeo - Business Casual - 3:43**

    Okay, saw these guys at the [House of Blues Boston](http://www.houseofblues.com/venues/clubvenues/boston/), 
    formerly the Avalon, and I must say, it was an amazing show.  Opened with 
    marching out to a pirate chant of 
        
        Chromeo, oahhhoah, Chromeo, oahhhhhhoah.  
        
    And killed it the whole rest of the show.

6.  **In The Summer (Picture House's 'Summer In The Balearics' Mix) - Crystal Fighters - 5:52**

    Hopefully there's enough summer left to chill to this song.  It's ridiculous.

7.  **Miami (Jono Ma and Franklin Furter Remix) - Foals - 5:19**
    
    I'm not a giant fan of Miami.  But whatever.

8.  **Lisztomania (Classixx Version) - Phoenix - 5:05**

    Jess turned me on to this remix, and it totally grew on me.  Standout arrangement

9.  **To The Lighthouse (Millionyoung Remix) - Memoryhouse - 3:12**

    Kind of a throw back to the Darling Buds meets Ladytron.  I like this remix
    much better than the original.  Just like most Gorillaz tracks, speaking of which...

10. **Empire Ants (Miami Horror Remix) edit - Gorillaz - 3:26**

    I cut this remix up as it is way too long, but it's still a great track.

11. **Kisses - Kisses - 4:12**

    I love this song even though it violates 100% of my pop rule blacklist, including:
    
    * Use of handclaps
    * cliched lines
    * about nothing
    * "Won't Stop, Can't Stop"

12. **Round and Round - Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti - Before Today - 5:09**
    
    Great song.  Almost didn't include it

13. **Shellshock - New Order (1986) - 6:30**

    This is how you should say "Won't Stop, Can't Stop" without saying it.

14. **Mr. Superlove - The Afghan Whigs - What Jail Is Like EP (1994) - 6:05**

    About something.
